# F1-2024-Theme
RLT theme in the style of the official F1 2024 graphics
## APPLY A CATEGORY TO YOUR SEASON
(see image)

Step 1: Create a category

Step 2: Apply category to the season

Color#1 -> Dictates the main colour of renders.

Color#2 -> Dictates the main color of the white (default) bar for P1.

I strongly recommend that you populate the "Short Name" field, as not all renders have the space to show longer season names.
Users can switch between "Season Name", "Category Name" and "Category Short Name" in theme options.

## DRIVER AVATARS
Setting Driver Avatars option to "Custom Avatars" means the theme will search for images named after the driver. Example: 

Driver Name: Dark373

Image Name: Dark373.png
